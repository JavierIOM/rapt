# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Profile name (e.g. "Helles") now correctly displayed on device card — was never appearing because `fetchProfileSession()` wasn't finding it; name is now read directly from `device.activeProfileSession.name` which is already present on the GetHydrometers response
- Critical OG unit bug: `activeProfileSession.originalGravity` is in SG format (e.g. 1.047) but was being divided by 1000 as if it were RAPT units, giving an absurd `ogSG` of 0.001047 and zeroing out all ABV/attenuation calculations — now normalised correctly (`< 2.0 → × 1000`)
- Session start date now read directly from `activeProfileSession.startDate` instead of via a redundant second API call to `/api/Profiles/GetProfiles`
- Removed unnecessary `fetchProfileSession()` call in the active-session branch — all needed data (name, OG, startDate) is already on `device.activeProfileSession`
- Removed diagnostic logging for `activeProfileSession` keys/raw dump added in the previous session

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Gravity velocity outlier values from the RAPT API (e.g. -209,000 ppd) no longer blow up the chart scale — values beyond ±100 ppd are treated as null/gap points
- Gravity velocity stat card now shows N/A instead of displaying absurd outlier values

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `temp-monitor.js`: null temperature no longer crashes the device loop — `device.temperature == null` is now guarded, logs a skip and continues cleanly
- `daily-summary.js`: attenuation no longer outputs `NaN%` when OG equals current gravity (division by zero) — guarded with `ogSG > 1.0` check, omits line if invalid
- `daily-summary.js`: null temperature readings no longer corrupt 24h avg/min/max stats or trigger false "Below safe min" status — nulls filtered before stats calculation
- `Content-Length` header now uses `Buffer.byteLength()` instead of `.length` across all three functions — correct for non-ASCII characters in credentials
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude entire `.claude/` folder rather than just `settings.local.json`
- Stale "08:00 UTC" schedule comment in `daily-summary.js` corrected to "07:30 and 19:30 UTC"

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Daily brew summary via Telegram at 08:00 UTC — current gravity (SG), OG, ABV, attenuation, gravity velocity, 24h avg/min/max temperature, battery, reading count
- `netlify/functions/daily-summary.js` — scheduled Netlify Function (`0 8 * * *`)

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Gravity stall detection — alerts via Telegram if gravity hasn't changed by more than 2 points over 48 hours
- Stall alert message includes current gravity in SG format and a prompt to check if fermentation is complete or stuck
- Stall alerts have independent cooldown (default 6 hours) via `STALL_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` env var
- `GRAVITY_STALL_THRESHOLD` env var (optional, default 2 RAPT gravity units) to tune sensitivity
- Telemetry fetch window extended from 2h to 49h to support stall detection

### Changed
- `getDeviceReadings` now returns full 49h telemetry array per device for stall analysis
- Temperature and stall alert state tracked under separate keys for independent cooldown behaviour

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Telegram temperature alerts via `@raptzilla_bot` — scheduled check every 15 minutes
- `netlify/functions/temp-monitor.js` — scheduled Netlify Function that fetches latest device readings and sends Telegram alerts for danger/warning temperature conditions
- Alert cooldown via Netlify Blobs (`@netlify/blobs`) — prevents repeat alerts within a configurable window (default 60 min)
- Four alert levels: danger-high, danger-low, warning-high, warning-low — each with independent cooldown tracking
- Monitor self-alerts via Telegram if it fails to fetch data
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` env vars
- `ALERT_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` env var (optional, default 60)

### Changed
- `netlify.toml` — added `[functions."temp-monitor"]` with `schedule = "*/15 * * * *"`

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- OG image generated at `public/og-image.png` (1200x630, fermentation-themed dark design)
- `scripts/generate-og.mjs` — sharp-based OG image generator, auto-runs before build
- `fb:app_id` meta tag added to index.html
- `og:image`, `og:image:width`, `og:image:height` and `twitter:image` meta tags
- CSS `--accent` variable (`#F56400`) for consistent orange accent across all themes
- `.time-range-select` CSS class — theme-aware select element replacing hardcoded `bg-white`
- Focus-visible rings on all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, select, links)
- `.device-card-header`, `.device-name`, `.device-meta`, `.device-id`, `.device-stats`, `.firmware-update` CSS classes for theme-aware device card content
- `.site-title`, `.site-subtitle`, `.site-footer`, `.footer-link`, `.footer-sep`, `.footer-muted`, `.refresh-btn`, `.status` CSS classes replacing hardcoded Tailwind dark-only colours

### Changed
- Dark mode is now the default — first-visit users see dark theme; light mode preference is persisted in localStorage
- `og:url` and `twitter:url` corrected from `rapt-dashboard.netlify.app` to `rapt.rockyroo.fish`
- Light theme palette updated to owner spec: page `#FAF7F4`, cards `#FFFFFF`, text `#222222`, secondary `#595959`, borders `#D9D9D9`
- Theme toggle buttons are now fully visible in light mode (were white-on-transparent, invisible)
- Modal, settings inputs, and all form elements now use CSS custom properties — work correctly in all four themes
- Chart.js legend, axis labels, tick colours, and grid lines now adapt correctly to dark/light mode
- Device card name, metadata, IDs, and firmware badge now use CSS variables (were hardcoded Tailwind classes)
- Header title, subtitle, status bar, footer, and refresh button now theme-aware

### Fixed
- Emoji removed from all alert banners: `⚠️ Low Battery Warning`, `🌡️ High Temperature Warning`, `🌡️ Low Temperature Warning`, `⚠️ Update Available`
- Time range select was hardcoded `bg-white` — broke in dark mode; now uses `.time-range-select`
- Modal content, header/footer borders, setting labels/descriptions/inputs all converted to CSS variable-driven styles
- Body element no longer carries a hardcoded Tailwind purple gradient class — light/dark backgrounds are fully CSS-controlled

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Old brew data no longer shown when a new brew session starts — telemetry is now filtered to the current session only
- Session detection uses profile session start date (from RAPT.io API) when available, falling back to gravity-jump detection (threshold: 8 gravity points) for sessions without profile data
- OG fallback now correctly uses the first reading of the current session, not historical data

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Favicon and comprehensive SEO meta tags

### Changed
- Updated documentation and version display to v2.2.0

### Fixed
- CORS restriction hardened to specific allowed origins
- Conditional verbose logging behind `DEBUG` env var (disabled by default)

## [2.1.0]

- Animated floating bubbles background
- Low battery and temperature alert banners
- Firmware update available indicator

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial release — RAPT.io API integration via Netlify Function
- Real-time temperature, gravity, ABV, and attenuation display
- ABV and attenuation calculated from telemetry with OG from profile session or manual override
